# React Native Mobile Flashcards

React Nanodegree Mobile Flashcards app is an app where users can add cards to each deck and answer questions from each deck daily. It is built with React Native & Redux. 

While React Native Mobile Flashcards should work on all iOS devices, it has been official tested on iPhone 7 (device) running iOS 11.4 - iPhone XR (simulator) 

## Requirements 
This application was bootstrapped with `create-react-native-app`.

Make sure you have `expo` installed so that you can have access to full functionalities when building & debugging.

If you do not have expo, install globally by doing:

`npm install -g expo-cli`

It is also important to have a computer running macOS with Xcode installed.


## Installation
1. Step 1: Clone this project `git clone https://github.com/AdoraNwodo/react-native-mobile-flashcards.git`
2. Step 2: Install all project dependencies (via npm) npm install
3. Step 3: Start the development server npm start
4. Step 4: Choose to run the app on an iOS simulator, or scan the QR code to run on an iPhone that has the expo app installed.

## Using the App 
On launching the app, you will need to create a deck by clicking the "+" button at thw bottom right. On click of the button, you will see a new screen where you would be able to create a new deck.
The list of decks would be on the homepage and you can click on each deck to either add more questions, take the quiz with the already existing cards in that deck or even delete the deck.
